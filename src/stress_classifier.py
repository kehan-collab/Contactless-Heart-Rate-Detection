"""
Stress Classification Module

Classifies cardiac stress level (Low, Moderate, High) from HRV
features using a rule-based scoring system. An optional secondary
classifier trained on labeled data can override the rule-based
output when available.

Scoring system (points accumulate → higher = more stressed):
    RMSSD  : 0–3 pts  (low RMSSD = parasympathetic shutdown)
    LF/HF  : 0–3 pts  (high ratio = sympathetic dominance)
    SDNN   : 0–2 pts  (low SDNN = reduced cardiac adaptability)
    pNN50  : −1 pt    (high pNN50 = good parasympathetic tone)
    Mean HR: 0–1 pt   (elevated HR = secondary stress indicator)

    Total max ≈ 9.5 pts
    LOW < 3 ≤ MODERATE < 6 ≤ HIGH

See docs/modules/05_stress_classification.md for implementation details.
